The webpage is in the index file.

In order to see the dash app, the code must be run and since colab generates a different link each time the dash app button will not redirect you to a working link as we don't have somewhere to host it. As a workaround, I have included the demo videos or if you want to try it you can use the address generated by running the notebook (the last code block should give you a clickable address for the app).
